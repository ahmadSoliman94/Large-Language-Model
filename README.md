# Large Language Model Development Roadmap

This repository provides a comprehensive roadmap for the development and deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). The process is divided into several key stages, each crucial for building effective and efficient models.

## Roadmap Overview

1. **Transformers**
   - Learn about transformer architecture
   - Understand key concepts such as attention mechanisms and positional encoding

2. **Vector Database**
   - Set up a vector database for efficient data retrieval
   - Explore vector indexing and searching techniques

3. **Prompt Engineering and Evaluation**
   - Develop effective prompts to guide model responses
   - Evaluate model performance based on different prompts

4. **LLM Fine-Tuning**
   - Fine-tune pre-trained models for specific tasks or domains
   - Monitor and adjust model parameters to improve accuracy

5. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   - Integrate external knowledge bases to enhance response quality
   - Implement techniques for dynamically sourcing information during generation

6. **LLM Frameworks**
   - Explore and integrate frameworks like LangChain and LLamaIndex
   - Utilize these tools to simplify development and enhance functionality

7. **LLM Deployment and LLMops**
   - Deploy models in a scalable production environment
   - Manage ongoing operations, updates, and monitoring to ensure model reliability
